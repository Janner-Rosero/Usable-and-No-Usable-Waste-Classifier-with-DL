## Models:
In this project we have used 6 models of architectures, each model has been applied with Transfer Learning methods. The models are as follows:

- InceptionV1 <Fine Tuning>
- ResNet50V2 <Fine Tuning>
- MobileNetV3 <Fine Tuning>
- MobileNetV3 + SVM <Feature extractor>
- VGG19 <Fine Tuning>
- VGG19 + SVM <Feature extractor>

## Dataset:
This dataset contains a total of 2015 photos (1015 of usable and 1000 of non-usable waste). Within this photos you can find food packaging, plastic and glass bottles, napkins, batteries, among others.

An example of photos of usable and non-usable waste is shown below:

### Usable
